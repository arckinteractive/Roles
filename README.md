Roles for Elgg
==============

This project implements user roles for Elgg, providing more granular control over the site than Elgg's default user distinction.

Elgg basically recognizes two types of users: members (ordinary users) and administrators (users who can do everything on the site).
More often than not, you'd need additional user types and associated privileges what each **user type** can do to your site.
By using this plugin, you can easily introduce custom roles, restricting groups of users to certain privileges.

Please understand that the Roles plugin, in its current state, **is rather a framework than a full stand-alone plugin.**
You'll need to make additional tweaks, or use extension plugins, to make the custom roles work.

## Introduction

The Roles plugin provides more granular control over your Elgg site than Elgg's default user
distinction. Elgg basically recognizes two types of users: members (ordinary users) and
administrators (users who can do everything on the site). There is a 3rd type of pseudo-user, the
**not-logged-in users**, who I'll refer to as visitors from now on.

More often than not, you'd need additional user types and associated privileges what each **user
type** can do to your site. You might want to limit group creation privileges to certain users, or
maybe you need special admin users (moderators) who can handle reported content, but can't
access other admin features (like installing new plugins).

These are just two of the many use cases I can think of, but this – and much more - is absolutely
possible with the Roles plugin. Before starting to use the plugin, please understand that the
Roles plugin, in its current state, **is rather a framework than a full stand-alone plugin**.
You'll need to make additional tweaks to make the above-described functionality of special roles
work.

## Intended audience

Though future versions of this plugin might target admin users with no php skills, in its current
state, **this is for Elgg developers** to implement user roles in an unobtrusive way. As of this
version, there is no user-friendly way to create or configure roles on your Elgg installation with
this plugin. Instead of managing roles and dragging role privileges around in a fancy admin
interface, you'll need to get your hands dirty and create a php configuration array to fully utilize
the possibilities of the plugin.

Having said that, if you're patient enough to read through this document, you'll be able to set up
specific roles for your Elgg site - even with very limited programming skills.

Also, I expect this plugin to spring a number of child plugins, defining custom roles. So even if
you don't want to absorb the dirty details, this plugin combined with future extensions might just
provide you with the granular access you've always dreamed of.

## Roles from a developer's view

Roles are represented as relationships called `has_role` between users and role objects. At any
given time, a user has either zero or one role relationship (**multiple roles per user is not
supported**). If a user does not have a role relationship, he/she will automatically be associated
with one of the default roles – more on that in the *Default roles* chapter.

In the current (1.0.0) version, role objects are automatically created from the role configuration
array. Whenever there is a change to the configuration array, the role objects will be updated
accordingly, without the need of running any upgrade script manually. However, the role changes
will not take effect until you reload any page on the site as a site administrator after saving the
role changes. The new page request will initiate an update to all role configurations, but **this will
only work if you are logged in as admin**.

Removing a role from the configuration array will not remove the corresponding role object. Only
permission changes to existing roles will be updated, and new roles will be created automatically.
To completely remove and replace all role objects with a new configuration set, disable, then reenable
the roles plugin. Note that this will also destroy any `user <-> role` relationship, i.e. all
users will lose their present role. Warning: This means that developers need to be especially
careful when modifying the roles plugin code in environments with existing roles since Elgg may
automatically disable the plugin if it cannot start. If you're unhappy with this behavior, just
remove the relevant part from activate.php – it's only a couple of lines of code.

## The `role` object

Role objects are instances of `ElggRole` class (extending `ElggObject` class), having the following
properties:
 * `name`: A unique string identifier of the given role (staff, super user, etc)
 * `title`: Displayed name of the role
 * `extends`: A flat array containing other role names that this role extends. These will be processed in the array's natural order when the role object is created or updated.
 * `permissions`: A serialized array describing all permission for the given role. More explanation on permissions is in the Configuration chapter.

Please note that role extension does not work in a dynamic, on-the-fly way. Extension is a tool to
simplify rule-set definitions: by extending `role2` with `role1`, you can say that *`role2` is very similar
to `role1`, except for the following rules: …* – and you only need to define the rules you need to
override from `rule1`. All role extensions are resolved when creating (or updating) the role object
from the configuration array.

There is a useful method attached to each role object called  `public function getUsers($options)`
which will return the list of users for the current role object. The array `$options` accepts the same
key => value pairs as the `elgg_get_entities*` functions.

## Default roles

There are 3 default (built-in) roles that come with the plugin: `VISITOR_ROLE`, `DEFAULT_ROLE`,
and `ADMIN_ROLE`. These roles will be automatically associated with users (or non-logged in
visitors) who do not possess a specific role.

The default roles were created based on the assumption that for most users, the simple
`member` role - that comes with Elgg by default - would be sufficient. Since we only need to
store role relationships for users having a non-default role, the number of role-related
relationships in the database is significantly reduced. At the same time, we can still define
specific rules for these default, built-in rules.

## Getting and setting user roles from code

The intention of this module is that plugin authors should be able to develop most functionality
without the explicit need of knowing a user's certain role. Most of role-based functionality – i.e.
what the user can see and interact with – can be moved to the configuration array; hence no
need for handling role based conditionals in the code.

In rare cases, when you do explicitly need to know what role a user has, you can get it by calling
the `function roles_get_role($user = null)` which will return the corresponding role object for the `$user` parameter.
If `$user` is not passed, it will return the role object for the currently logged-in user. Note that this function is guaranteed
to return an `ElggRole` object – if the user does not have a specific role, one of the default role
objects will be returned.

Even more unlikely that you'll have to explicitly set a user's role, but it's still possible with the
`function roles_set_role($role, $user = null)`
which expects a role object, and optionally the user whose role needs to be set. If `$user` is not
passed, it will set the role for the currently logged-in user.

For getting all role objects, or a specific one, use the following two functions:
`function roles_get_all_roles()`
`function roles_get_role_by_name($role_name)`

## Setting user roles via user settings page

There is a specific view `roles/settings/account/role` that implements a role selector control. This
is essentially a drop-down box with all the defined custom roles in the system, and an additional
item called **No specific role**.

By default, this view is only added to the user settings page if the current user has the default
`ADMIN_ROLE`. Of course, the beauty of this plugin that you can define other roles, that may have
the same privileges for changing user roles.

## Configuration

### The configuration array

As of this version, there is no fancy admin interface to set up role permission; this has to be done
via an associative configuration array. The array for default roles resides in the
`mod/roles/lib/config.php` file, and has the following structure (example not showing all configuration details):

```php
$roles = array(
	VISITOR_ROLE => array(
		'title' => 'roles:role:VISITOR_ROLE',
		'extends' => array(),
		'permissions' => array(
			// permissions
		)
	),
	DEFAULT_ROLE => array(
		'title' => 'roles:role:DEFAULT_ROLE',
		'extends' => array(),
		'permissions' => array(
			// permissions
		)
	),
	ADMIN_ROLE => array(
		'title' => 'roles:role:ADMIN_ROLE',
		'extends' => array(),
		'permissions' => array(
			// permissions
		)
	),
);
```

You can override permissions of any of the default roles, or add new roles to the configuration.
The recommended way to do this is by creating a lightweight plugin called `yoursitename_roles`,
and register for the `'role:config', 'role'` plugin hook with a priority greater than 500. Your hook
will be triggered by the roles plugin and expect role definitions to merge into the original role
configuration array.

Here is an example of how to implement the `'role:config'` hook:

```php
function myroles_config($hook_name, $entity_type, $return_value, $params) {
	$roles = array(
		'limited_users' => array(
			'title' => 'yoursitename_roles:limited_users',
			'permissions' => array(
				'actions' => array(
					'groups/save' => array('rule' => 'deny')
				),
			),
		)
	);
	if (!is_array($return_value)) {
		return $roles;
	} else {
		return array_merge($return_value, $roles);
	}
}
```

The above code adds a new role to the system identified as `limited_users`. Members of this role
will not be able to create groups, as defined by the permission section of the configuration array.
Permissions will be explained in more detail later.

The above `$roles` associative array could contain any number of new roles and override
definitions for the default roles (`VISITOR_ROLE`, `DEFAULT_ROLE`, and `ADMIN_ROLE`). The first
level keys (in the above example the single role key `limited_users`) should be unique within
the Elgg installation – this key is the primary identifier for roles. When another plugin defines
the same role with different rule sets, the later definition will override earlier definitions.

Note how the above hook function uses graceful role definition: instead of just returning the new
role definition array, it merges with the previously existing array. This is how your role extension
should generally behave, letting other plugins define other sets of roles.

The `permissions` section holds individual permission rules that determine what the user can see
and interact with on the site. Permissions can contain sections of rules relating to menu items,
views, pages, actions, plugin hooks and events. For most of these permission sections, the basic
permission rules are as follows:

 * `deny`: Deny access to a specific item. In some cases this will generate an error message
   and result in a redirect (for actions and pages), other cases the given item will simply not
   be rendered (for views and menus). In case of hooks, the specified hook handler will not
   be triggered. In case of events, you can unregister an event handler.
 * `allow`: Allow access to a specific item. This rule is most useful when extending rules –
   the default role can deny creating new groups, while an extension of the default role can
   specifically re-allow group creation.
 * `extend`: Add a new item on the fly to the current page – this works for hooks, events,
   menus and views. I.e. you can add role specific menu items, extend existing views and
   create new plugin hooks or event listeners, just by using the right configuration values.
 * `replace`: Replaces an existing item. Works for views, menus, hooks and events.
 * `redirect`: Redirects to another page. Works for pages.

### Menu permissions

Menu items can be dynamically removed from or appended to any Elgg menu. To disable the
**Members** main menu item for the default role, the configuration would look like this:

```php
$roles[DEFAULT_ROLE] = array(
	'title' => 'roles:role:DEFAULT_ROLE',
	'extends' => array(),
	'permissions' => array(
		'menus' => array(
			'site::members' => array('rule' => 'deny')
		),
	)
);
```

The	`menus` configuration section can contain any number of menu rules, each using the
`menu-name::item-name` structure as key, for identifying the menu item to act on. A more
complex example shows the menu section from a role configuration that extends the default role:

```php
$permissions['menus'] = array(
	'site::members' => array(
		// 1st menu rule
		'rule' => 'allow'
	),
	'site' => array(
		// 2nd menu rule
		'rule' => 'extend',
		'menu_item' => array(
			'name' => 'books',
			'text' => 'Books',
			'href' => 'books/all',
		)
	),
	'site::groups' => array(
		// 3rd menu rule
		'rule' => 'replace',
		'menu_item' => array(
			'name' => 'mygroups',
			'text' => 'My Groups',
			'href' => 'groups/member/{$self_username}',
		)
	),
	'filter::friends' => array(
		// 4th menu rule
		'rule' => 'deny',
		'context' => array('bookmarks', 'files')
	),
);
```

The first rule will override the default role's ruling on the Members menu item – it will be visible
again for those users who have the above role.

The second section demonstrates how to add a new menu item to any given menu dynamically
for a role. Here the menu is identified by a simple `menu-name` instead of the `menuname::item-name` structure.
The rule says to extend the selected menu with a new item, and the new item itself is defined after the rule,
under `menu_item`. The menu_item associative array expects the same key-value pairs as the `ElggMenu::factory()` method.
To put it short, this rule will add a new menu item called **Books** to the main menu, and will link to the books/all
page. Of course, you'll still have to actually implement the content of that page.

The 3rd rule shows how to replace an existing menu item in a menu. For this role's members, the
standard **Groups** link in the site menu will be replaced **My Groups**, pointing to those groups
that the current user is a member of. Note the dynamic variable in the href part: `{$self_username}`.
This reference will be replaced with the currently logged-in user's
username. Read more about dynamic page paths in chapter **Using dynamic paths**.

The 4th rule shows how to create context-dependent rules. The rule removes the Friends item
from the **All, Mine, Friends** content filtering menu, leaving only **All** and **Mine**. However, as
there is a context defined for this section, the rule will only kick in when the current context is
one of the predefined contexts. In other words, the **Friends** item from the filter menu will only
be removed on the Bookmarks and File pages.

### Pages permissions

Accessing pages can be denied or allowed per role; pages can also be silently redirected by the rule set.

```php
$permissions['pages'] => array(
	'groups/add/{$self_guid}' => array(
		'rule' => 'deny',
		'forward' => 'groups/all',
	)
);
```

The above rule will deny access to the **create new group** page, will register an error message to
inform the user, and forward him/her to the **Groups** front page. If no forward address is
specified, the user will be forwarded to the referrer page. Note that you can use the same
dynamic substitutes as described at the Menu permissions section.

The rule `forward` behaves the same way as `deny`, except it does not register an error
message – it will simply silently forward the user to another page.

The `allow` rule will override a previous role's `deny` or `redirect` rule for a given page path.

### Views permissions

Views can be suppressed, extended or replaced for any roles. Consider the following examples.

```php
$permissions['views'] = array(
	'input/password' => array('rule' => 'deny'), // 1st view rule
	'forms/account/settings' => array( // 2nd view rule
		'rule' => 'extend',
		'view_extension' => array(
			'view' => 'roles/settings/account/role',
			'priority' => 150
		)
	),
	'object/blog' => array( // 3rd view rule
		'rule' => 'replace',
		'view_replacement' => array(
			'location' => 'mod/modified_blog/extended/views/',
		)
	),
);
```

The first rule simply suppresses the `input/password` view. This is a rudimentary way to disable
password changing for certain roles. The view will simply not be displayed, without any warnings
or error messages.

The second rule shows a more useful example of roles based view management: it extends the
`forms/account/settings` view with a new one, `roles/settings/account/role` – which happens to
be the role selector box. In other words, this rule will allow members to change their (and other
users') role. The `extend` rule behaves the same way as an `elgg_extend_view()` call would, but
now the view extension is moved from source code to role configuration.

The third rule shows how to replace an existing view for a certain role. The view replacement
works the same way as a call to the `elgg_set_view_location()` function would, the location being
relative to Elgg's installation path. In the example, we replace the blog view with a different one
for this role.

### Actions permissions

Actions have pretty simple rule options: allow and deny. To disable access to a specific action,
use:

```php
$permissions['actions'] = array(
	'registered/action/name' => array('rule' => 'deny')
);
```

In case of trying to access a non-permitted action, an error message will be registered, and the
user will be forwarded to the referring page.

### Hooks permissions

Plugin hook handlers can be registered, unregistered or replaced for any roles.

```php
$permissions['hooks'] = array(
	'usersettings:save::user' => array(
		'rule' => 'extend',
		'hook' => array(
			'handler' => 'roles_user_settings_save',
			'priority' => 500,
		)
	),
);
```

The example above will register a new handler for a role that will be triggered by the
`'usersettings:save', 'user'` hook. Obviously, you'll still have to implement the handler function.
The above example, as is, is used by the roles plugin for the default `ADMIN_ROLE`. The handler
implementation takes care of saving the user's role, if it has been changed on the user settings
page.

Hooks should always be identified either by the hook name, or the hook name and the hook
type, separated by a `::` (double colon). If the hook type is not defined, the type `all` will be
assumed.
When you `deny` a hook, the roles plugin will basically unregister the given hook handler, or all
handlers for the specified hook.

```php
	$permissions['hooks'] = array(
		'usersettings:save::user' => array(
			'rule' => 'deny',
			'hook' => array(
			'handler' => 'user_settings_save',
		)
	),
);
```
This will unregister the default Elgg handler for saving user settings, meaning that members of
this role will not be able to save any changes to their settings page. Admittedly not a brilliant
example, but you should get the general idea. A bit better example would be to replace the
default hook for saving user settings, like this:

```php
$permissions['hooks'] = array(
	'usersettings:save::user' => array(
		'rule' => 'replace',
		'hook' => array(
			'old_handler' => 'user_settings_save',
			'new_handler' => 'custom_user_settings_save',
		)
	),
);
```

### Events permissions

Event permissions work much the same way as hooks; event handlers can be registered,
unregistered or replaced for any roles. An example for registering an event listener via the
configuration array

```php
$permissions['events'] = array(
	join::group' => array(
		'rule' => 'extend',
		'event' => array(
			'handler' => 'custom_join_group_handler',
		)
	),
);
```

Whenever a member of the above defined role will join a group, the
`custom_join_group_handler` function will be called, where you can do whatever you need to do
– for example notify all group members of this fact.

### Using dynamic paths

For action paths and page request URIs, it can be useful to have more advanced path definition
possibilities than declaring a static string. You have two options to achieve more complex path
matching: using built-in variables and regular expressions.

You can use the following variables in any URL or path-like parameters:

* `{$self_username}` The username of the currently logged-in user
* `{$self_rolename}` The role name of the currently logged-in user
* `{$self_guid}` The GUID of the currently logged-in user
* `{$pageowner_username}` The username of the current page owner
* `{$pageowner_rolename}` The role name of the current page owner
* `{$pageowner_guid}` The GUID of the current page owner

The above variables will be replaced when resolving page, menu and action paths. You can see
an example of this at the **Menu permissions** chapter. You can also use regular expressions for
your path definitions, as seen below:

```php
$permissions['actions'] => array(
	'regexp(/^admin\/((?!user\/ban|user\/unban).)*$/)' => array(
		'rule' => 'deny'
	)
);
```

The above action rule will match all `admin/*` actions, except for `admin/user/ban` and
`admin/user/unban`, and deny access to all matching actions. In other words, we just created an
admin user with very limited capabilities, the user will be able to ban and uban other users, but
won't be able to perform any other administrative actions.

When using regular expressions, you'll have to wrap your pattern string in a `regexp( )` pseudocall.
This will tell Roles' rule parser to interpret the expression inside as a regular expression.

When combining the above two techniques, i.e. using both built-in variables and regular
expressions, please remember that first the variables will be resolved, and the resulting,
substituted pattern will be passed to the regular expression matcher.

## Guidelines for role implementations *using real world examples*

As you can see from all the configuration options, you have a pretty flexible set of tools to
implement different roles for you Elgg user. For most purposes, you'll have to use a combination
of rules to achieve your goals in a secure way.

### Implementing the Group Administrator role

Consider the following, commonly requested role: only privileged members should be able to
create and edit groups. To implement this, you'd need to take the following steps.

 * Override the default role.
 * In your default role definition, deny access to the **Create a new group** menu item on group pages.
 * Also deny access to the **Groups I own** menu item in the sidebar (so you won't confuse your ordinary members with a dead link).
 * Deny access to the `groups/add/{$self_guid}` page.
 * For security reasons, deny access to the `groups/edit` action that is called both when creating a new group or editing an existing one.

With the above rules, you practically shut down every access to group creation for default
members. Now all you have to do is to define another role for group administrators (who can
create and edit groups). The rule set of this role can be totally empty – as this is a new role, the
above-defined restrictions do not apply to members of this role. They will simply be able to
access all those pages, actions and menus just as any member in a vanilla Elgg installation.
To make someone a group admin, simply visit (as an admin user) the target user's settings page,
and set his/her role to the newly created group administrator role.

Additionally, if you want to make this feature really convenient, you can add new menu items to
the hovering context menu that can be opened in the corner of member icons. This is slightly
more complicated, here is how you can do it.

 * Override the default admin role.
 * Add a new handler to the hook section of the configuration array by extending the `'register', 'menu:userhover'` hook.
 * Implement the handler function.
 * Inside your handler, check for the current role of the user (user is passed as parameter from the hook trigger).
 * If the current role is group administrator, add a new menu item to the hover menu called **Revoke group admin privileges**. If the current role is the default member role, add a
   new menu item to the hover menu called **Grant group admin privileges**. Link these menu items to two separate actions.
 * In your action implementation, set the user's role explicitly to group administrator or default member, as necessary.

There is a full working example of the above role configuration at the Elgg Community. Look for
the plugin **roles_group_admins**.

### Implementing the Moderator role

Another very common request I saw on the community is the ability to elevate certain members
to Moderators. Moderators can edit content created by other users, and ban/unban them.
However, they aren't able to perform any other administrative actions, like installing plugins or
changing site settings.

The natural approach from Roles point of view is to extend the default `ADMIN_ROLE`, and gradually revoke most of the administrative rights via `deny` rules.

 *  Create a new role called `moderator`, overriding the default admin role.
 *  In this new role, deny access to all admin pages, except the reported content pages. This can be achieved by using regular expression for the page matching pattern.
 *  Remove the generic **Administration** link for the top bar by denying access to the `administration` menu item in the `toolbar` menu.
 *  Add a new menu item to either the topbar menu or the site menu that links directly to the reported content page.
 *  Deny access to all administrative actions except for banning and unbanning users. This, again, can be done by using regular expressions for the action matching.
 *  Finally suppress the whole view displaying the administrative sidebar. This is to remove all administrative shortcuts when showing the reported content page.
    And that is all. You can now make a Moderator from any user by first elevating the user to admin, then setting his/her role to Moderator. There is a full working example of the above role
    configuration at the Elgg Community. Look for the plugin `roles_moderators`.

### Conventions for custom role developers

If you're implementing a specific role and you think that it might be useful for others as well, by
all means please release it on the community site. Here are a couple of tips on creating a role
extension plugin:

 *  Start your plugin's name with `roles_` – an example is `roles_group_admins` for the previous example.
 *  Use a pattern like **My specific role for Roles** for your plugin title, so role-related searches will your awesome extension
 *  In your manifest file, use the `<requires>` tag to indicate that your plugin is dependent on the roles plugin.
 *  In your role configuration hook, use graceful role definition: instead of just returning the new role definition array, merge it with the previously existing array.
 *  Keep security in mind. It's usually not enough just to remove an item from a given menu – you'll want to deny access to corresponding pages and actions as well.
